1. Create JAR for Michael when delivered equip is verified but over $75. - add JavaScript that allows michael to approve or if linked inbound update to Pending Equipment Return OR give view of Job Activities where there is no linked JAR but over $75

2. Test setting [Route Revision Approval] to approve and see what that does.
 
-- Make [Route Revision Approval] only editable to Michael if not linked RR JAR, read-only if there is a linked JAR. Make visible

-- Get rid of 'denied' setting [Route Revision Approval]

Read-Only all the time. Only readable by Michael if its set to 'Pending'
- no jar but over $75 OR is a JAR and its auto approved 
- and under $75 with a JAR and if 

Put outcomes into a matrix:

Default value = NULL (means theres already a JAR)
PENDING = 
- no JAR but over $75 >> changes to APPROVED



PENDING: over $75 and no linked installer JAR and [Actiivty Pay Status] == 'Pay Revision Pending'

APPROVED: once Michael Reviews (over $75)/ no linked installer JAR. 



- When [Route Revision Approval] == 'Approved' [Activity Pay Status] updates to 'Pending Equipment Return' IF there is a linked and active inbound case 

add another pick list value to [Job Equip Status] 'Override - Customer Lost Equipment - Release Pay' and 'Override - Installer Reports Equipment has been Returned - Release Pay' >> Resolves inbound case and updates [Activity Pay Status]

- if there is an invoice to the installer, then that invoice is to be canceled.


Save Job Activity 




2. After resolution of JAR and there is an inbound then [Activity Pay Status]

3.
