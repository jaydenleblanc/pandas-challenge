Data Analysis with Pandas:

Pandas Challenge:

In this project I analyzed data for fictional gaming company for their game titled, Heroes of Pymoli. For context, this game was free-to-play, but players were encouraged to purchase optional items that enhanced their playing experience. This project generates a break down report of the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

Methods Used:

- Importing csv files
- Storing content in variables, dictionaries, lists
- Creating/Manipulating Dataframes
- Leveraging mathematical methods on dataframe objects

Technology Used:

- Python
- Pandas Library
- Numpy Library

Project Description:
This project was my initial practice in using Jupyter Notebooks to conduct data analysis. Many of the methods used required research and application to find the following information:

- Player Count

  - Total Number of Players

- Purchasing Analysis (Total)

  - Number of Unique Items
  - Average purchase price
  - Total Number of purchases
  - Total Revenue

- Gender Demographics

  - Percentage and Count of Male Players
  - Percentage and Count of Female Players
  - Percentage and Count of Other/ Non-Disclosed

- Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
  (each broken down by gender)

  - Purchase Count
  - Averaeg Purchase Price
  - Total Purchase Value
  - Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

- Age Demographics
  (broken into bins of 4 years) - Purchase Count - Average Purchase Price - Total Purchase Value - Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

- Top Spenders
  ( Identify the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value) - SN - Purchase Count - Average Purchase Price - Total Purchase Value

- Most Popular Items

  - Item ID
  - Item Name
  - Purchase Count
  - Item Price
  - Total Purchase Value

- Most Profitable Items
  - Item ID
  - Item Name
  - Purchase Count
  - Item Price
  - Total Purchase Value
